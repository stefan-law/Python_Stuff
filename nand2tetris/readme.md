These are my solutions in Python for the second half of the nand2 tetris course: 

Ch6: An assembler that interprets the Hack assembly code and creates the relevant machine code.

Ch7: A VM translator for the Hack byte code that produces Hack assembly code. Intermediate functionality with ability to handle stack arithmetic commands and memor segment access.

Ch8: Completed the VM translator with added functionality including branching, function call, and return abilities.
